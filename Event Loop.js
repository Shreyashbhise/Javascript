🔄 What is the Event Loop in JavaScript?
The Event Loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows it to handle asynchronous operations (like setTimeout, fetch, or Promises) without blocking the main thread.

🧠 Key Idea:
JavaScript is single-threaded (executes one thing at a time), but thanks to the Event Loop, it can still perform non-blocking asynchronous tasks.

⚙️ How It Works:
Call Stack – Executes synchronous code line by line.

Web APIs – Handle async operations (e.g., timers, HTTP requests).

Callback Queue – Stores callbacks from async tasks once they’re ready.

Microtask Queue – Stores resolved promise callbacks (executed before callback queue).

Event Loop – Monitors the call stack and pushes queued tasks when the stack is empty.
  

📋 Simple Example:

console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise");
});

console.log("End");
✅ Output:


Start
End
Promise
Timeout


🟩 Why This Order?
Start and End run first (synchronous).

Promise callback is a microtask → runs before the setTimeout callback.

Timeout callback comes from the callback queue.

📌 In Short:
The Event Loop enables JavaScript to run asynchronous code efficiently by executing callbacks only when the call stack is empty, ensuring the app stays responsive.

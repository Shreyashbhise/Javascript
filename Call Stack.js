ðŸ”¹ 1. Call Stack
âœ… What is it?
The Call Stack is where JavaScript keeps track of function execution. It handles synchronous code â€” one function at a time.

ðŸ§  How it works:
When a function is called, itâ€™s pushed onto the stack.

When the function returns, itâ€™s popped off.

Only one function runs at a time â€” JS is single-threaded.

ðŸ“Œ Example:

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
greet();


// pushed to stack â†’ runs â†’ removed
